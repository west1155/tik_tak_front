# TIK-TAK-TOE FrontEnd(UI):

Requirements

Bits is built upon Fractal, a tool that enables the rapid development of components, templates and pages. Fractal uses a number of ES6 features, so this project requires Node.js v4.0+ to be installed locally. A global install of Gulp is also recommended.
Installation

To get the project up and running, and view components in the browser, complete the following steps:

    Download and install Node: https://nodejs.org/
    Clone this repo: git clone git@github.com:24ways/frontend.git (SSH) or git clone https://github.com/24ways/frontend.git (HTTPS)
    [Optional] Install Gulp globally: npm install gulp -g
    [Optional] Install Fractal globally: npm install fractal -g
    Install project dependancies: npm install
    Start the development environment: npm start
    Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000

Development

When developing components, you may want assets automatically compiled and the browser to refresh automatically. To do this, run the following task:

    npm run dev

Creating a static build

To create a static instance of this project, run the following task:

    npm run build

This will create a folder called www, into which the required files will be created.
Deployment

To make this project publicly accessible, you can deploy a static instance by running the following task:

    npm run publish

This will publish the contents of public to your gh-pages branch.
